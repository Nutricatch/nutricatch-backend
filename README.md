## OPEN API

## Authentication
Login and register endpoints are available to get an access token. This token is required to access the rest of the API. The token is valid for 7 days.

```
POST https://examplehost:3000/auth/login 
-------
Body {email: string, password: string }
-------
Return {message: string, access_token: string}
```

For registration, the email must be unique and the password length must be strong enough. The password must contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number and a special character.


```

Body {name: string, email: string, password: string}
